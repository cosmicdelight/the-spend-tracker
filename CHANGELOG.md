## Unreleased

### Added

- **Duplicate transaction** — In the Edit Expense dialog, use Duplicate to create a copy of a transaction with today's date. Useful for recurring expenses (e.g. weekly groceries, similar purchases).
- **Auto-populate category from description** — When adding an expense, if you enter a description but leave Category empty, the category (and sub-category) is filled on blur based on past transactions with matching descriptions.
